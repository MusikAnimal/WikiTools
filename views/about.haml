  %section.description
    This tool attempts to offer accurate data on how many edits a user has made without the assistance of semi or fully automated tools. A few important notes:
    %ul
      %li All data is approximate.
      %li Deleted contributions are not currently accounted for.
      %li It may take a while to generate data for users with a large edit count. Currently the contribution history is not generated for users with over 50,000 contributions.
      %li Some tool counts overlap. For instance, Twinkle can perform Moves. Consequently the sum of the tool counts may not equal the total number of automated contributions.

  %section.tools
    There are currently #{tools.length} supported tools that this counter looks for. They are as follows:

    %div.list
      %div.list-item
        %span.id.heading>
          ID
        %span.name.heading>
          Name
        %span.regex.heading>
          Regex
      %div.list-item
        - projectPath = "https://en.wikipedia.org"
        - tools.each do |tool|
          %span.id>
            = tool[:id]
          %span.name>
            %a{href: "#{projectPath}/#{tool[:link]}"}
              = tool[:name]
          %span.regex>
            = tool[:regex]

    More tools can easily be added. Feel free to request an addition at
